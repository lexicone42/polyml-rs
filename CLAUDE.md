# polyml-rs — notes for future participants

## What this is

A Rust rewrite of PolyML's bytecode interpreter, runtime, and image
loader. Goal: faithful port of upstream's `vendor/polyml/libpolyml/`
semantics with stronger memory safety and a friendlier development
loop. See `PLAN.md` for the staged roadmap.

## Where we are

End-to-end, our runtime executes the real PolyML bootstrap image:

```
$ poly run vendor/polyml/bootstrap/bootstrap64.txt
Executed 1111155 bytecode step(s).
Result: Tagged(0) — clean return
```

Pipe SML to stdin and it compiles:

```
$ echo "1+1;" | poly run vendor/polyml/bootstrap/bootstrap64.txt
Error- in '<stdin>', line 1.
Type error in function application. Function: 1 : int ...
```

## Bootstrap image structure (important!)

`vendor/polyml/bootstrap/bootstrap64.txt` is **Stage 0** — the bare
PolyML compiler with NO basis loaded. It's designed to be driven by
piping `bootstrap/Stage1.sml` to stdin with `-I <srcdir>` so it can
locate basis source files. The build command:

```
./polyimport bootstrap/bootstrap64.txt -I . < bootstrap/Stage1.sml
```

Consequences for testing:
- `1 + 1;` produces a type error — `+` exists as an overloaded
  identifier but no concrete overload is registered.
- Infix declarations (`infix 6 +`) and operator overloads
  (`RunCall.addOverload FixedInt.+ "+"`) are NOT in scope at the
  initial REPL. The first lines of `basis/InitialBasis.ML` install
  them.
- For minimal arithmetic without loading basis files, prepend the
  necessary declarations:
  ```sml
  infix 6 + -;
  RunCall.addOverload FixedInt.+ "+";
  val x = 1 + 2;  (* now succeeds *)
  ```

The `bootstrap_can_register_infix_plus_and_compute` test in
`crates/polyml-bin/tests/cli_run.rs` exercises this path.

To actually load the basis and reach "1 + 1 prints 3", we need real
file I/O (PolyBasicIOGeneral subcodes 3/4/8/9 for open/read).

## Open issues

- **Post-error PC crash**: after a handled exception's error path
  prints to stderr, the bootstrap's continuation eventually hits
  "pc out of bounds (offset 322739 into segment of 128 bytes)".
  Successful runs are unaffected. The handler-depth tracking is
  correct as of `9853c02`; the issue is some missing detail in
  the post-handler RETURN/cleanup sequence.

- **File I/O**: PolyBasicIOGeneral subcodes 3 (open text input)
  and 4 (open binary input) are still stubs returning TAGGED(0).
  Implementing them + real reads from non-stdin fds (subcodes
  8/9 for arrays) is the gating step toward loading the basis.

- **GC**: none. The bump allocator leaks. Bootstrap-and-exit
  workloads don't notice; long-running programs would OOM.

## Diagnostic tooling (use it!)

Before guessing at a bug, build a histogram. The hot-PC tooling
found the killer RESET_1 bug in ~30 minutes after weeks of
hand-tracing failed:

```rust
let interp = Interpreter::from_code_object(...)
    .with_default_alloc_space(...)
    .with_rts(rts)
    .enable_diagnostics();

// ...run...

let diag = interp.take_diagnostics().unwrap();
for ((code, off), cnt) in diag.hot_pcs(20) {
    println!("code=0x{code:016x}+{off:5} visits={cnt:10}");
}
```

CLI:
```
poly run --profile --trace-rts <image>
```

`--trace-rts` logs every RTS call; `--profile` prints a hot-code
histogram on exit. See `crates/polyml-runtime/tests/exec_bootstrap_profile.rs`
for a deeper-stop-and-dump example.

## RTS calling conventions

The most common cause of arity-mismatch bugs:

| SML wrapper      | C signature           | Our arity |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| `rtsCallFastN`   | N args, no threadId   | Arity-N   |
| `rtsCallFullN`   | (threadId, N args)    | Arity-(N+1) |
| `rtsCallFast0 "X"` invoking `unit -> ?` | C is `(void)` but SML passes unit | Arity1 |

The last row is the gotcha: PolyML's C side accepts the extra arg
silently because x86-64 ignores unused register args. Our typed
dispatch must match the call site exactly.

## Where the upstream reference lives

`vendor/polyml/libpolyml/bytecode.cpp` is the bytecode dispatcher
we're porting. Keep cross-references in comments — every non-trivial
opcode handler in `crates/polyml-runtime/src/interpreter/mod.rs`
cites the upstream line range.

## Don't merge RESET variants

`INSTR_RESET_N` (drop top N) and `INSTR_RESET_R_N` (preserve top,
drop N below) look identical but aren't. Merging them silently
corrupts every loop using RESET to discard a result. See the comment
in `mod.rs` around `INSTR_RESET_1 => self.drop_n(1)`.
